        <h1>Minecraft Burnout: how to stay motivated after the hype fades</h1>

        <p>
            The “2-week Minecraft phase” is real. The first days are pure magic:
            punch tree, get tools, build shack, become unstoppable.
            Then the world asks you a question: “So… what now?”
        </p>

        <p>
            This page is a structured guide to help you keep playing without turning Minecraft into a second job.
            The goal is not maximum efficiency. The goal is <strong>long-term fun</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Why burnout happens (and why it's not a character flaw)</h2>
        <p>
            Burnout usually shows up when your plans get bigger than your feedback loop.
            Early game rewards you every few minutes. Mid-game rewards you every few hours.
            Your brain notices the delay and starts negotiating: “What if we just… watch a video instead?”
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Too many goals:</strong> you collect ten “big ideas” and finish none.</li>
            <li><strong>Grind overload:</strong> gathering becomes the main activity, not the support activity.</li>
            <li><strong>No narrative:</strong> you're building things, but they don't connect to a theme or story.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The STTWMP method (simple enough to actually use)</h2>
        <p>
            Here's a light structure you can reuse every session:
            <em>Theme → Loop → Reward</em>. If your world has those three, it survives.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Theme:</strong> Say your world out loud in one sentence. (Example: “Old ruins reclaimed by
                gardens.”)</li>
            <li><strong>Loop:</strong> Pick one gameplay loop for the session (build, explore, farm, or gear-up).</li>
            <li><strong>Reward:</strong> End with a visible improvement (a landmark, a path, a new room, a map wall).
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>5 motivation tools that don't require “discipline”</h2>
        <p>
            These are tactics that reduce friction instead of demanding willpower.
            When you're tired, your system should carry you.
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>1 Build smaller on purpose</dt>
            <dd>
                If your idea is a “mega base,” split it into “micro-finishable” chunks.
                Example: today you only finish the entryway and storage wall.
            </dd>

            <dt>2 Make one thing ugly first</dt>
            <dd>
                Give yourself permission to draft. Minecraft is weirdly nicer when you treat builds like sketches:
                rough shape first, details later.
            </dd>

            <dt>3 Convert grind into “infrastructure”</dt>
            <dd>
                If you need resources, build a system that produces them while you do other stuff
                (starter farms, simple villager trading, mine pathing, nether shortcuts).
            </dd>

            <dt>4 Leave a “next-session hook”</dt>
            <dd>
                Stop on a cliffhanger. Put materials in a chest near the build. Place a sign:
                “Next: roof + lanterns.” Future You will thank you.
            </dd>

            <dt>5 Add something silly</dt>
            <dd>
                A world lasts longer when it has jokes. Make a tiny museum, a dramatic statue, a suspicious alley,
                or a “totally safe” lever.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>A starter checklist for the next time you load the world</h2>
        <p>
            If you only do one thing from this page, do this:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Pick <strong>one</strong> goal that fits in 30-60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pick <strong>one</strong> support task (materials, tools, or food).</li>
            <li>Pick <strong>one</strong> “fun chaos” task (decoration, joke build, explore).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When you should actually take a break</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes the correct move is to stop. If Minecraft feels like guilt,
            or you're forcing it, that's your signal.
            Breaks aren't failure—breaks are part of the loop.
        </p>
