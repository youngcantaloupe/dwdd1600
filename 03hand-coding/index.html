        <h1>Surviving the 2-week Minecraft Phase</h1>

        <p>
            You know the cycle: you launch Minecraft “for a relaxing night,” and suddenly it's 2:38am and you're
            calculating how many stacks of stone you need for a base you will <em>definitely</em> finish.
            Two weeks later… the world sits there like an unfinished group project.
        </p>

        <p>
            This site is a playful, practical guide for anyone who's ever hit the <strong>Minecraft motivation
                cliff</strong>.
            It's not a lecture. It's a survival manual.
        </p>

        <h2>1 What even is the “2-week phase”?</h2>
        <p>
            It's the burst of obsession where everything feels fresh: early tools, early shelters, early goals.
            Then the mid-game shows up with its classic combo: big plans, repetitive gathering, and the sudden
            realization
            that you are now employed by your own base.
        </p>

        <h2>2 What this site will help you do</h2>
        <p>
            The goal is simple: give you enough structure to keep a world alive without turning the game into homework.
            You'll get strategies that work whether you're building solo, on a server with friends, or living in a
            one-person village where the only resident is “Future You.”
        </p>

        <h2>3 Quick-start: a low-stress plan</h2>
        <p>
            If you're already feeling the burnout creeping in, try the smallest possible reset:
            pick one tiny “win,” one playful “mess,” and one “future gift.”
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>One tiny win:</strong> finish something that takes 10-20 minutes (a doorway, a storage wall, a
                path).</li>
            <li><strong>One playful mess:</strong> build something dumb on purpose (statue, pixel art, tiny “museum”).
            </li>
            <li><strong>One future gift:</strong> set up a convenience for later (nether tunnel stub, farm starter, map
                wall).</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Pick a world theme in one sentence (example: “cozy river settlement with bridges”).</li>
            <li>Choose one build you can finish in a day (a cabin, a tower, a starter barn).</li>
            <li>Stop while it's still fun—leave yourself a breadcrumb for next time.</li>
        </ol>

        <dl>
            <dt>Burnout</dt>
            <dd>When the game starts to feel like chores instead of play—usually right after you invent a 9-step plan.
            </dd>

            <dt>Mid-game wall</dt>
            <dd>The moment you realize progress now depends on repeating tasks (mining, farming, hauling) more than
                discovery.</dd>

            <dt>“Next-session hook”</dt>
            <dd>A tiny note or setup that makes it easy to return later (example: materials placed, sign posted, a clear
                next task).</dd>
        </dl>
