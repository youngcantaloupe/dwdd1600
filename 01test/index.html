    <h1>Digital Citizenship</h1>
    <h2>What is Digital Citizenship?</h2>
    <p>Digital citizenship is the practice of using digital technologies ethically, responsibly, and effectively as a member of a connected society. It's less about technical skill and more about judgment, behavior, and participation in digital spaces.</p>

    <h2>What is Digital Law?</h2>
    <p>Digital law is the body of laws and regulations that govern behavior, rights, and responsibilities in digital environments. It translates traditional legal principles—property, privacy, speech, liability—into contexts shaped by software, networks, and data.</p>

    <h2>What is AUP?</h2>
    <p>An Acceptable Use Policy is a formal document that defines what users are allowed and not allowed to do when using a digital system, network, service, or platform. It functions as a rulebook for behavior and usage, setting boundaries to protect users, infrastructure, and the organization providing the service.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Plagiarism</h2>
    <p>Plagiarism is the act of presenting someone else's work, ideas, or expressions as your own without proper acknowledgment.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Academic Dishonesty?</h2>
    <p>Academic dishonesty is any action that violates the rules of academic integrity by giving an unfair advantage, misrepresenting your work, or undermining the learning process.</p>

    <h2>What are the rules for AI Generated Content?</h2>
    <p>The rules for AI-generated content are not universal; they depend on context (school, workplace, platform) and policy.</p>
